Minmal GUI for croc file transfer. Easy File Sharing for Discord
Please remeber. This is just a simple AutoIt Script to make life easier. It probably has a lot of bugs at the moment.
Code Optimizing is still pending. Testing is still pending. Feel free to use or do whatever you want with it.
And yes. There are better solutions than AutoIt, but it is working ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Used ISN AutoIT Studio

**Installation:**
- Extract Croc into a folder of your choice -> https://github.com/schollz/croc/releases
- Extract CrocReceiver.exe into the folder where you extracted croc.exe 
- Run CrocReceiver.exe to register handles and right click menus for files and folders. It will ask Admin rights to do this! 
- You are ready to go

**Deinstallation:**
- Run Croc Receiver.exe. It will unregister handles and remove right click menus. It will ask for Admin rights to do this! 
- Delete Croc and CrocReceiver files
- You are done

**Receiving Files:**
